1. Code returns an error because it doesn't recognize the quotation mark character used in this line. From google it seems this is a typographic quotation mark (â€˜) which isn't supported. Need to use these types of quotations: ' and "
2. Error, same issue as above. Uses unsupported typographic quotation mark.
3. We should not use var because of it's function scope, which can cause issues like naming conflicts and scoping issues due to its ability to be accessed outside the block it was declared in. For people with experience in other languages, var is simply more trouble than it's worth, as block-scoped variables like let and const allow you to do the same things in a more intuitive manner and without the hassle. For example, if you wanted global scope, just declare a block-scoped variable outside all the functions. If you want a function-scoped variable, just declare a block-scoped variable within the function but outside any inner blocks.
